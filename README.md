This is a collection of short object oriented programs developed to learn the capability of
python to control new and legacy National Instruments Modules.  New versions of LabView 
will often not work with or older NI modules.  By downloading the appropriate version of NIDAQMX
python can be used to create fully functioning data acquisition and control applications.
